## Introduction

Welcome to the Rotary Fellowship of Developers' guide on how to use GitHub! Whether you're new to development or an experienced coder, this guide will help you navigate GitHub, an essential tool for collaborating on our projects.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration, allowing you to work more effectively with others on projects.

## Setting Up Your GitHub Account

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a new account if you don't already have one.
2. **Configure Your Profile**: Add a profile picture, set your name, and write a brief bio so fellow contributors can get to know you.

## Joining the RotaryDEV Fellowship on GitHub

1. **Find Our Organization**: Visit [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/rotary-dev-fellowship) and explore our repositories.
2. **Request to Join**: Send a message to our admin team or follow the joining instructions provided on our website.

## Basics of GitHub

### Repositories

A repository (or "repo") is where project files are stored. Explore our repositories to find projects you're interested in.

### Issues

Issues are used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs. You can comment on an issue to express interest or ask questions.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

PRs let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository. When you're ready to contribute, submit a PR with your changes.

## Making Your First Contribution

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a copy of the repository by forking it.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine with `git clone <url>`.
3. **Make Changes Locally**: Work on the task or feature, making sure to follow the project's contribution guidelines.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Use `git commit` to save your changes.
5. **Push to Your Fork**: Upload your changes to GitHub with `git push`.
6. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and click "Pull Request" to let the team know you have changes to merge.
