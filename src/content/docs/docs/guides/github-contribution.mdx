## Basics of GitHub

### Repositories

A repository (or "repo") is where project files are stored. Explore our repositories to find projects you're interested in.

### Commits

Commits are snapshots of your project at a specific point in time. When you make changes to a file, you commit those changes to save them.

### Branches

Branches are used to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project. You can create a new branch, make changes, and merge them back into the main branch.

### Forks

Forks are copies of a repository that you can modify without affecting the original project. You can fork a repository to work on a feature or bug fix.

### Issues

Issues are used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs. You can comment on an issue to express interest or ask questions.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

PRs let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository. When you're ready to contribute, submit a PR with your changes.

## Making Your First Contribution

<Steps>
  1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a copy of the repository by forking it.
  2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine with `git clone <url>`.
  3. **Make Changes Locally**: Work on the task or feature, making sure to follow the project's contribution guidelines.
  4. **Commit Your Changes**: Use `git commit` to save your changes.
  5. **Push to Your Fork**: Upload your changes to GitHub with `git push`.
  6. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and click "Pull Request" to let the team know you have changes to merge.
</Steps>
